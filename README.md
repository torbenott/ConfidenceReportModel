# Confidence Report Model

MATLAB implementation of a confidence-guided time investment model. The model estimates how faithfully a decision maker uses their statistical confidence to guide post-decision time investment (waiting time), and fits a single time investment efficiency parameter α that captures sub-optimality in this process.

## Overview

In the task, subjects make a binary perceptual decision and then invest time waiting for a potential reward. Time investment reflects confidence: higher confidence → longer waiting. The model:

1. **Estimates the mapping function** `ti = m(c)` that converts statistical confidence `c = P(correct | evidence, choice)` into time investment, by matching the model confidence distribution to the empirical waiting time distribution
2. **Fits time investment efficiency α** via maximum likelihood — α = 1 means optimal confidence use for time investment, α = 0 means time investment is random with respect to confidence

Three model variants are compared against data: a shuffle control (α = 0), the optimal model (α = 1), and the best-fit model (α fitted by MLE).

This code was tested on a Windows 11 computer with standard hardware and MATLAB2024b and 2025b. For installation, clone the repository and run RunConfidenceReportModel.m. Installation time less than 1 min, expected run time of demo script with simulated data less than 1 min. 


## Output

A single 2×3 figure:

| | col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **row 1** | Calibration curve | Vevaiometric curve | Conditioned psychometric |
| **row 2** | Psychometric fit | Mapping function m(c) | Alpha log-likelihood |

Confidence signatures (row 1) show empirical data (markers) overlaid with the three model variants (dashed = shuffle, thin solid = optimal, thick solid = best-fit α).
