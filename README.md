# Confidence Report Model

MATLAB implementation of a confidence-guided time investment model. The model estimates how faithfully a decision maker uses their statistical confidence to guide post-decision time investment (waiting time), and fits a single time investment efficiency parameter α that captures sub-optimality in this process.

## Overview

In the task, subjects make a binary perceptual decision and then invest time waiting for a potential reward. Time investment reflects confidence: higher confidence → longer waiting. The model:

1. **Estimates the mapping function** `ti = m(c)` that converts statistical confidence `c = P(correct | evidence, choice)` into time investment, by matching the model confidence distribution to the empirical waiting time distribution
2. **Fits time investment efficiency α** via maximum likelihood — α = 1 means optimal confidence use for time investment, α = 0 means time investment is random with respect to confidence

Three model variants are compared against data: a shuffle control (α = 0), the optimal model (α = 1), and the best-fit model (α fitted by MLE).
